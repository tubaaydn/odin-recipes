        <h1>Green Goddess Salad</h1>
        <img src="./img/green-goddess-salad.jpeg">
        <p>This bowl is just as delicious and scoop-able. Use a food processor 
            to shred and chop the cabbage if your knife skills aren't up to the task. 
            The dressing is so tasty that we recommend mixing up an extra batch to use 
            on grilled veggies, fish and even as a sauce for pizza!</p>

                shallot, garlic, anchovy paste, and lime juice in a 
                high-powered blender; blend and slowly add oil through 
                top opening of blender until mixture is smooth, about 1 minute, 
                scraping down sides if needed. Add mayonnaise and salt; blend until 
                smooth. Cover and chill until ready to serve.</li>
